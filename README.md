## Usage
### Status info
`git status` command (default method) but copy pasteable
```sh
> dukit -b

 Staged
 src/lib.rs

 Modified
 README.md
 src/base_commands.rs

 Untracked
 hi.txt
```
### Branch info 
Notice how easy copy pasting should be 

```sh
> dukit -b

  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

  feature/git-switch-interactive
  main

```

### Fuzzy branch switching 
```sh
> dukit -f

 #opens fzf
    test2
    test1
â–Œ   feature/git-switch-interactive
  3/3 â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
> {search bar here}

 Switched to branch 'feature/git-switch-interactive'
```

### Interactive `git add` 
This opens your default editor with files to add

```sh
> dukit -i

# Staged
 out.tape

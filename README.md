## Usage
### Status info
`git status` command (default method) but copy pasteable
```sh
> dukit

  S
  src/lib.rs

  M
  src/lib.rs

  U
  .gitignore
  README.md
  duck.gif
```
### Branch info 
Notice how easy copy pasting should be 

```sh
> dukit -b

  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

  feature/git-switch-interactive
  main

```
### Interactive `git add` 
This opens your default editor with files to add

```sh
> dukit -i

# Staged
 out.tape

# -------------------------------------

# Unstaged
[ ] README.md
[ ] .gitignore
[x] demo.gif

# Selected files to be staged like so below V
# [x] file.txt
# Lines begining with (#) will be ignored

> running git add demo.gif
  demo.gif staged

```
## Installation
```
cargo install dukit
```
